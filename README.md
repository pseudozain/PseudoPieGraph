## Usage

PseudoPieGraph is easy to use and first import PseudoPieGraph to file where you want to use it:

```swift
import PsuedoPieGraph
```
Initialize PseudoPieGraph as ```lazy``` property or in Stroyboard/Xib file. Here example is give for initializing through code.

```swift
lazy var pieGraph: PseudoPieGraph = {
    let pieGraph = PseudoPieGraph()
    pieGraph.startAngleDeg = 45
    pieGraph.selectedArcEdge = -5
    pieGraph.emptyRadius = 0
    return pieGraph
}()
```

Add ```pieGraph``` to view in ```viewDidLoad(_ :)``` method.

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    view.addSubview(circledPieGraph)
}
```

Now set ```componets``` of pie graphs. And run your App.

```swift
override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillAppear(animated)
    
    pieGraph.frame = CGRect(x: view.bounds.width/2 - 125, y: label.frame.origin.y + label.frame.height + 40, width: 250, height: 250)
    
    cpieGraph.components = [(number: 0.2, color: .orange), (number: 0.1, color: .systemBlue), (number: 0.15, color: .systemTeal), (number: 0.15, color: .systemRed), (number: 0.25, color: .purple), (number: 0.15, color: .systemPink)]
